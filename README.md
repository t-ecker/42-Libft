# Libft - 42 School

## 🏆 Score: **XX/100**

## 📖 About the Project

🛠️ *Note: This version of Libft includes additional functions like* `ft_printf` *and* `get_next_line` *that were not part of the initial subject.*

Libft is a custom implementation of standard C library functions, built from scratch. It is the starting point for learning the fundamentals of C programming, memory management, function implementation, and coding style.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Deep understanding of C standard library functions
- Manual memory allocation and management
- String manipulation and linked lists
- Writing reusable and clean code

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C
- **Compiler:** GCC

## 🚀 Usage

To compile and use **libft**, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t-ecker/42-Libft.git
cd libft
```

### 2️⃣ Compile the Library

```bash
make
```

This generates **libft.a**, the static library containing all implemented functions.

### 3️⃣ Use it in Your Project

You can include **libft** in your own C projects by linking it during compilation:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror your_file.c -L. -lft -o your_program
```

### 4️⃣ Include the Header

Make sure to include the library header in your source files:

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

## 🔗 Projects Using Libft

Libft is a core library that serves as a foundation for several projects at 42, including:

- **ft\_printf** (custom printf implementation)
- **get\_next\_line** (efficient file reading function)
- **push\_swap** (sorting algorithm project)
- **minishell** (basic shell implementation)
- **cub3d** (simple 3D game engine using raycasting)

## 🏁 Conclusion

Libft is a foundational project at 42 that strengthens core C programming skills. It serves as a great resource for future projects requiring basic utility functions.
